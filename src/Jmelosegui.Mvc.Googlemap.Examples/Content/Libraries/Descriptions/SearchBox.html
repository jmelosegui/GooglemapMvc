<p>
    This sample shows how to use googlemap api libraries features througt this control even when they are not totally supported by the control in a "pure mvc way".
</p>

<p>
    You just need to add the library you want to use
</p>

<pre class="prettyprint">
    @(Html.GoogleMap()
        .Name("map")
        .Height(500)
        .Libraries(new [] {"places"})
        .ClientEvents(events => events.OnMapLoaded("mapEvent"))
    )
</pre>

<p>
    And then using the map event <b>OnMapLoaded</b> you can get a reference to the map and accomplish your task using javascript.
    See the view tab for more details
</p>
<p>
    The places search box allows users to perform a text-based geographic search, such as 'pizza in New York' or 'shoe stores near robson street'. You can attach the SearchBox to a text field and, as text is entered, the service will return predictions in the form of a drop-down pick list.
